name="Mass Calculator"
description="Blender-inspired mass calculator for RigidBody3D nodes. Automatically calculates the mass of a selected RigidBody3D based on its collision shapes. If the selected node is not a RigidBody3D, the plugin performs a deep search to locate and compute the mass for any RigidBody3D nodes within the scene, using their associated collision shapes."
